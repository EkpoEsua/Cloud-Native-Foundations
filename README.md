# Cloud-Native-Foundations
A Udacity course on designing and implementing applications using the principles of microservices and cloud native architecture, using python and Flask framework.

## Course Objectives

* The design considerations amd tradeoffs for building microservices/cloud native applications involves an understanding of the functional requirements as well as the resources available.
* Best implementation practices to ensure full observability of the applications to facilitate ease of monitoring and resilence when deployed.
* Containerize an application using docker, creating an docker image, runing the image and deploying it to docker hub.
* Create a kubernetes cluster on a virtual machine created using vagrant.
* Configuring and deploying a Kurbenetes cluster using k3s.
* Understanding and implementing the concepts of Deployments, Replicaset and rolling out strategies, for deploying verisons of an application in order to ensure availability, resilence and scaling.
